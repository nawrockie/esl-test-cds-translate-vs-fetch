# A '0' in a T<n> column above indicates the sequence 'passed' the test.
# A '1' in a T<n> column above indicates the sequence 'failed' the test.
#
# Only data for sequences that fail >= 1 test OR have an ambiguous nucleotide in them are printed [change to all seqs with -a]
#
# Test 1 (T1): Length of CDS (DNA) is a multiple of 3 (or stop is incomplete)
# Test 2 (T2): Fetched protein starts with an M (or is annot. as incomplete on 5' end)
# Test 3 (T3): CDS ends with a stop codon (or is annot. as incomplete on 3' end)
# Test 4 (T4): CDS has 0 Ns that make AA assignment ambiguous
# Test 5 (T5): Translated CDS and fetched protein are identical length
#              (ignoring final codon, if it's a stop or incomplete)
# Test 6 (T6): Translated CDS and fetched protein are identical sequence
#              (ignoring hangovers if lengths differ and final codon (if stop) and codons with ambiguous nts)
# Test 7 (T7): No internal stops in translated CDS
# Test 8 (T8): No internal stops in fetched protein
# Test 9 (T9): CDS has a linked protein accession
# Test 10 (T10): CDS is complete on the 5' end (not annotated as incomplete on 5' end)
# Test 11 (T11): CDS is complete on the 3' end (not annotated as incomplete on 3' end)
#
# Other non-obvious column meanings:
# "start":     codon_start annotation, CDS translation begins at this position of CDS (usually 1)
# "tr-len":    length of CDS to be translated (annotated length - (codon_start - 1))
# "num-Ns":    number of N nucleotides in the CDS sequence
# "num-oth":   number of other ambiguous nucleotides (non-N, non-ACGT) in the CDS sequence
# "pass/fail": 'pass' if all tests pass (have 0s in their respective columns), else 'fail'
